# ⛏ FiveM CCore [Corazon Core]
A framework that I coded, I would continue to update, I publish it so that it continues to live and that there are contributors who contribute to the project, there is a bunch of dev who have largely the skills to take over, so I'm counting on you :)

# 🐌 How to use it ?
For the moment it is not fully usable, but it will be soon, for the moment we are looking for contributors to speed up the work.

# 🐌 How to contribute?
You have to fork the project, once done, you create a branch and you add what you would like to see on the framework, once that is done, I will examine the modification, if I find that it could be beneficial for the project, I add it, otherwise I don't accept it

# 🐌 Pre-Required
 - [MySQL Async](https://github.com/brouznouf/fivem-mysql-async)

# ⚠️ Warning
Downloading and publishing this resource on Github without using the github Fork option is not allowed and may result in a suspension of the repository. I invite you to respect my work and that of collaborators. 

It does not work with esx, it replaces it
